Checkwriter
===========

Using templates similar to the format of the check (*.chk) files of [GnuCash](https://gnucash.org), this module and its binary programs allows the user to print checks on standard sizes of paper.

The default is to print a single check on Office Depot's single-check paper (US Letter size) using the provided check template file. The font used is the **E-13B, Common Machine Language font** in a free (for non-commercial use) implementation called the *MICR Encoding Font* provided by **[1001 Fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/micr-encoding-font.html#styles)** with reasonable [terms of use](https://www.1001fonts.com/licenses/general-font-usage-terms.html). That font is the standard expected for the US and is also used in some other countries. See the [TECHNICAL](./TECHNICAL.md) file for more information on banking standards and check specifications.

SYNOPSIS
========



    %*ENV<CHECKWRITER_PRIVATE_DIR> = "/path/to/private/dir";
    use Checkwriter;
    checkwriter write-check [interactive process]

DESCRIPTION
===========



The user's default personal or business bank account and other private information are in the files represented by the files in the 'resources' directory:

  * 'account.hjson'

    Contains the bank account data. 

  * 'register.json'

    Contains records of checks written.

  * 'check.hjson'

    Contains the data to define the physical layout of a printed check.

The file names are **not** required to be the same but, in any case, they must be provided in the user's `$HOME/.Checkwriter/config.yml` which will be created if it doesn't exist and be populated with the example names. That default file looks like this:

    # file: $HOME/.Checkwriter/config.yml
    #   file names:
    account-data:  account.yml
    check-data:    check.hjson
    register-data: register.json

All are shown as examples in the `resources` directory. All the `.hjson` input files use the `Hjson` format (see module `JSON::Hjson` for more information) and the `.yml` files use the `YAML` format (see module `YAMLish` for more information).

Customization
-------------

The user is provided usable templates in the 'user-check-data.hjson' and 'user-account-data.hjson' files for his or her own use to print checks on the Office Depot check paper. Merely change the personal data to that desired. The 'user-register.json' file will be populated as checks are written.

Usage
-----

After customizing your account and check data as discussed above, you are ready to print a test check to see if all data are correct.

Planned features
----------------

  * Ability to print multiple checks in one batch

  * Ability to use other standard check papers

  * Ability to use multiple checking accounts

  * Ability to use other fonts and currency symbols for other world regions

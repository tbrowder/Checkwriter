Rethinking input files, outputs, and other products:

Inputs:
======

+ a yml file for account and bank data
    default file name: account.yml
    unique key / private value to be printed on a check

+ an hjson template for placing data on a check
    default file name: check.hjson

    unique keys, some are used in the yml files
      to access the private data
    other values describe the output objects
      to be printed

+ a yml config file to name actual file names used above
    required file name: config.yml

Output:
======

+ an output json file for the check register
    default file name: register.json

Note all files above must be in one of two places, in
search order:

  1. a directory pointed to by the environment variable
     CHECKWRITER_PRIVATE_DIR
  2. directory $HOME/.Checkwriter

The files should be considered static data for one
or more class instances.

Variables:
=========

+ a temporary hash for transactions
    unique key / private value to be printed on a check
      keys: amount
            pay-to
            date
            memo

Classes:
=======

Need a standard object to describe an origin,
type, and content on the check.

Need a way to describe relative positioning for
an object. For example, data that might go on
a line. Each object should have a unique id
among the input files..

# CheckWriter

Using Hjson templates similar to the format of the check (*.chk) files of [GnuCash](https://gnucash.org),
this module and its binary allows the user to print checks on standard sizes of paper.

The default is to print a single check on Office Depot's single-check
paper (US Letter size) using the provided check template file. The
font used is the *E-13B, Common Machine Language font* in a free
(for non-commercial use) implementation called the *MICR Encoding
Font* provided by
**[1001 Fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/micr-encoding-font.html#styles)**
with reasonable
[terms of use](https://www.1001fonts.com/licenses/general-font-usage-terms.html).
That font is the standard expected for the US and is also used in some
other countries.  See the [TECHNICAL](./TECHNICAL.md) file for more
information on banking standards and check specifications.

## SYNOPSIS

```
use CheckWriter;

# write the resources data from the installed module
checkwriter add-resources
checkwriter write-check payee=jones.hjson [user=user.hjson] [bank=user-bank.hjson]
```

The data for the payee is in the `jones.hjson` file. The user's default
personal or business check information is in the `user.hjson` file, and
the user's default bank information is in the `user-bank.hjson`
file. All are shown as examples in the `data` directory. All the hjson
input files use the `Hjson` format (see module `JSON::Hjson` for more
information).

## Planned features

+ Ability to print multiple checks in one batch
+ Ability to use other standard check papers
+ Ability to use other fonts for other world regions
